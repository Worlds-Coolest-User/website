Western River Battle - A "tribal hunt" of 450 soldiers (300 soldiers,150 cavalry) of Srak march south to cleanse the area of tribal raiders who have been making life difficult in the region for some time. While heading south, the army of Srak encountered a group of Gazg skirmishers camping on both sides of a tributary of the Western river. Three divisions of tribals were on the western side of the river, and one on the east. Steep hills bracketed the river in this area, and the armies were forced to fight on the narrow strips of land beside the river. After some initial progress, the Srak were pushed back.

Round 1 - Tribal forces are aware that the Sraks are marching south. Blindly, the Srak army is following the river, general Ts'ektal in the lead, confident in reports that the tribals are a day's march away.

Round 2 - The armies close.

Round 3 - Tribal Warband I rushes forward to pelt the enemy with javelins, but Division I and the general's cavalry close in and wipe out a significant portion of their unit. Tribal javelin attacks do nothing to dissuade the Srak units.

Round 4 & 5 - Javelin attacks intensify, and the Srak begin to take casualties. Division I takes especially heavy fire as it fords the river to engage Tribal Force IV, which is the only force on the south side.

Round 6 - Division I engages Tribal IV, while Division II destroys Tribal I and clears the way for the general's cavalry to press forth. The Tribal counterattack does little to dissuade them.

Round 7 - Tribal III is similarly engaged, and the General and Division II press forward to engage the fresh but shaken Tribal II. Tribal IV struggles with Division I.

Round 8 - Division II is beaten back.

Round 9 - Tribal II begins a blistering assault against the general, but the cavalry endures. Tribal IV fails to have an effect and is almost done for.

Round 10 - The cavalry is defeated. Tribal IV is likewise extinguished, but Division I is badly wounded. Rather than engage the remaining tribals, which would surely be futile, the Srak army decided to quit the field.

FINAL:

Srak:
Division 1: 2/15 52% dead = 9/15
Division 2: 0/15 22% dead = 12/15
Cavalry: 0/15 16% dead = 13/15
Total: 30% dead

The infantry is limping and will have to call in aid to be an effective fighting force again. The cavalry has fared much better - not much more than the rearguard perished as the rest fled after seeing Division II defeated.

Tribal:
Tribal 1: 0/15 20% dead = 12/15
Tribal 2: 7/15 38% dead = 9/15
Tribal 3: 0/15 19% dead 12/15
Tribal 4: 0/15 48% dead = 8/15

Total: 31% dead

The tribal force is reduced by roughly a third. They may still be able to fight, but they are noticeably diminished and shaken by the experience. They hold the field for now, but it may be difficult for them to hold a force of similar strength at bay again.
