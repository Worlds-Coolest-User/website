<br>
<p>The Portal from Earth is partially embedded in sandstone, a piece of which juts out and destroys the PC's wagon as it emerges. Players fall the remaining four feet to the ground, incurring 1d4-2 falling damage.
<br>
<p>The characters find themselves at the base of a small cliff. The area around them (hex B9) is grassy, with the occassional hill rising above the countryside. The Portal is embedded in one of these hills, apparently there for millennia. The grass all around is faintly orange, and the sky has a yellow tinge. Even the sun is wrong - it is clearly redder than the sun they know.
<br>
<p>Just ahead is a small blockhouse. The doors to the palisade around it have been pulled down, and characters who investigate can easily spot marks left by the large hooks used to accomplish this. The remains of a half dozen men are scattered around; they have been killed, their hearts and gonads cut out. Each one wears leather armor which has been heavily damaged, although if the characters take three turns (30 minutes), they will be able to put together enough for two full suits. They otherwise wear kilts and a thick undershirt to prevent chafing, but nothing more. The men appear to have died recently, and there is some evidence that scavengers may have taken a few experimental bites, but they chose not to eat the bodies.
<br>
<p>The small blockhouse has been thoroughly looted. Every piece of metal and glass has been taken. A man with a bow lays dead in the middle of the room, the assailants being uninterested in his flint-tipped arrowheads. The food and water are likewise untouched, and there are enough supplies here to keep the entire party provisioned for three days. 
<br>
<p>If the party spends a half hour searching, they will uncover a hidden cache inside a pillow: 15gp, several letters from a "Meredeth", apparently the recipient's sister, and a gold ring which allows the user to cast <i>Protection From Evil</i> once per day as a level 1 Magic-User (whoever puts it on feels a tingle in their hand; it's only when they try to "do something" with it is the spell revealed). An axe is embedded in the ceiling there, likely thrown there by mistake and missed by the tribal lizardman scavengers after the battle ended.
