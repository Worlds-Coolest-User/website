<p>While journeying across the countryside, the party of adventurers encounters a great red dragon! The giant lizard does not attack, however, but speaks to the party of a simple mission.</p>

<p>Rohalandrin tearfully introduces himself and explains that he is experiencing some problems with his lair. Pieces from his treasure hoard are being stolen. If the party would be so kind as to accompany him to his lair and help rid the place of thieves, the dragon would be most grateful.</p>

<p>As Rohalandrin tells his story, he attempts to enchant the entire group of adventurers (an advanced form of <i>Charm Person</i>, human characters must roll 21+ vs spells to resist it). Once the party is mesmerized, he will take them up and leave behind anyone who successfully resisted him. The lair turns out to be a castle floating in the clouds!</p>

<p>The dragon lands on the castle roof (see level B). The treasure hoard is heaped in one former.</p>

<p>As the adventurers are released from the dragon's spell, Rohalandrin states the party's mission: rid the castle of its bothersome inhabitants. In the process, the party is to pick up whatever treasure they uncover. From this, Rohalandrin will identify the stolen items and return them to his hoard. In return the dragon promises to return the adventurers to their meeting-place with the remainder of their plunder.</p>
