<p>A toppled statue of a reptilian human. Its groin, chest, and parts of its head were destroyed with chisels and hammers in the remote past. The words "Hoc idolum anno 1154 a Carolo Romania et Petro Hlesstekh exorcizatum est" are carved into it as well. Characters who can read Latin will know that this says "This idol was exorcised 1154 by Charles the Romanian and Peter Hlesstekh."

<p>Two <a href="encounterpage.html#LizardTribal">tribal lizardmen</a> lounge here, thoroughly inebriated. They have been working their way through a mini-barrel of wine, and they will not notice tresspassers outside of the tent unless they are addressed. All of their actions are performed with a -3 penalty and their movement is reduced to 20' because of their current condition. They speak only their tribal language and carry bronze-tipped spears.

<p>Two human prisoners are found here, bound with leather thongs. One is a civilian courier who was carrying letters to the fort, and the other is a seasoned infantryman. Both are frightened but still have their wits about them.
