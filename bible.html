<div class="a"><center><b><u><font size="+1">The Lizardian Bible</font></u></b></center>

<p>The Bible of the non-Catholic lizardmen has been amended in various ways to make it more compatible with lizardman culture and values. Additionally, there is a seventeenth book wherein a traveler named Hashk of Etsekhh meets Jesus and learns about the geography of Israel as its author imagined it, e.g.:

</div>

<div class="b">

<p>17:14 Hashk said to Jesus, I am a traveler here and wish to see Kateru [Capernaum]; where is it?

<p>17:15 Jesus said, Kateru is twenty <i>tetec</i> (60 miles) to the north of Cherusla [Jerusalem] on the shores of the sea.

<p>17:16 Now Hashk said, am I permitted to travel abroad on the seventh day, which is the day of rest?

<p>17:18 Jesus told him, humans must rest on the Sabbath, but not the green men, who are blessed.

</div>

<div class="a">

<p> And so on. Other amendments include:

<p>Various unknown mammals mentioned in the book are changed to local fauna. The camel of 10:25 becomes a triceratops, for example.

<p>The man with the crippled hand in 3:1-5 is specified to be a lizardman. 3:6 is amended to say that the spies are angered because aiding lizardmen is contrary to the law of Cherusla.

<p>The Greek mother in 7:26 becomes a female nest-warden.

<p>Jesus tears flesh from his body and pours blood from his veins to feed his disciples at the Passover feast in book 14, repeating the miraculous feeding of the masses in chapter 6. When Judas objects, Jesus reminds him of his words in 7:18-23.
