<p>The Lizard Wizard (Lissit Hacak, "Lizard Magic-er", "lissit" being a direct loan from English) is a magic-user hatched in <a href="locations.html#srak">Srak</a>. His childhood began normally, but his natural facility with magic caused his brain to become hyperdeveloped, and his cranium grew to be twice as large as normal for a lizardperson. It was  clear as he became an adolescent that he could either pursue a career in magic or be killed and eaten by his peers, and he made his way through Magic School before fleeing into the wilderness to avoid paying his student apprenticeship fees. He maintains some correspondence with his peers in Srak and St.Irene, but has not entered a city in over a century.</p>

<p> The Lizard Wizard's currently lives in a ruined city at (6,-5) that has been mostly buried in numerous landslides. A small tribe of troglodytes have been lured to the area to serve as reluctant guards, but they rarely go aboveground during daylight house and only have a 10% chance per hour of detecting trespassers. They fight as normal, but their morale will drop to 6 if they are forced to fight during the day or while the moons are between first and third quarter. The Lizard Wizard also possesses The Lizard's Head, a magical artifact whose possessor can control the minds of dinosaurs.</p>

The tower is made of rough-hewn stone and rises four stories. There is no ornamentation save for some iridescence on the glass of its few windows. Two adult pachycephalosaurs and four juveniles are milling around the tower; the Lizard Wizard is using them as guards, but only exerting light control at the moment. If the party is seen, the dinosaurs will immediately attack. The juveniles must make a morale check whenever one of the adults are killed.

This room is a 20 foot wide, 40 foot long corridor. The walls are painted with crude but detailed drawings of Lizard Men eating each other.

<br>

This is the quarters for several of the Lizard Men who are employed as guards and servants. There will always be at least a couple of them in this room.

This area is used to store miscellaneous equipment, most of which has been taken from captured slaves. Within this room can be found several stone weapons, various clothes (both for Lizard Men and for Humans), and a variety of other semi-useful stuff.

In addition to the stairs which are the only way up to the towerâ€™s upper floors, this room will contain all prisoners currently being held. In general there will be 2D4-2 prisoners, each of which has a 10% chance of being Human. The prisoners will be chained to the wall and the only key to the locks on the chains is held by the Lizard Wizard. Aside from the lack of exercise, the prisoners are treated quite well as some of them are expected to survive for several months before they will be eaten. There will always be four guards on duty in this room.
