<p>
Party is "executed" in Westfordshire, England and arrives at the (0,0) portal, where they take in the blue-green plant life, yellowish sky, and red-tinged sun and first conclude that they are either in Purgatory or Hell. They explore a small nearby fort and discover a massacre. The party moves "west" (actually north) to avoid the perpetrators of the massacre, and, because they have now changed their minds and discovered that they are in the Holy Land, to find the Mediterranean coast, where fellow Christians will bring them home to England.

Party attempts to rob a caravan of scaly, green skinned, and tail-having Moors, but it goes poorly and Matt is beaten unconscious by the caravan's guards and held hostage until his comrades surrender five iron nails (250gp), and they are given one glazed pot in a mocking imitation of a trade. The Moors go on their way, looking somewhat bloodied but far richer than when they set out. The party follows the south bank of the river in the hopes of reaching the Mediterranean, where they expect to find fellow Christians and return to England.

Western River discovered. A group of "barbarian" Moors visit the camp at night but are intimidated by the Englishmen (and Scot) and leave. Party chooses to follow the river west.
<p>(Lizardman caravan arrives at St. Irene (2,0) and reports their encounter; 6 member contact team dispatched immediately, seven member team dispatched to (0,0) to find out why the newcomers were not being escorted. <p>Tribal raiders arrive at their camp at the ruin of the temple of Hlats at (1,-3). Barbarian lizardmen encountered on 8/31 are massacred by raiders at (-2,2).

<p>"Rocs" are spotted feeding on tribal Moorish bodies. After chasing them off with some shouting and arm-waving, some weapons and food are recovered.
<br>
<center><b><a name="903">9/03</a> to 9/04 (-3,3)</b></center>
<p>The river turns north, and a treeline is visible off to the west. A herd of bone-skulled animals gets too close to camp that night and one is successfully hunted and killed. More meat is recovered, and the party is finally eating well after several days of hunger. However, everyone in the party but Tom wakes up violently ill. The contact team arrives shortly thereafter and greets them in English.
<p>(The seven-man team arrives at the (0,0) fort and discovers the massacre there. After spending the night nearby, they begin their return to St. Irene. A group of ten raiders and two prisoners leave the temple of Hlats and begin to retrace their steps to the fort, where the prisoners have promised them that there is more loot to be found).
