<td>New Canaan is an area which has been blessed by the Archangel Raphael, and is the only region on the surface of Sartash which can support terrestrial plant life. The land is a torus encircling the Blessed Lake at its exact center. The land is surrounded by three rings of stone walls and is effectively a single massive fortress. The land within is intensively cultivated and dotted with hamlets.</td>
